Once upon a time...
As the artifact shattered, the dark presence vanished, and the village was restored to its former glory. The villagers rejoiced and celebrated the sorcerer's bravery and wisdom. From that day forward, the sorcerer was not only a beloved member of the village but also its guardian, ensuring that no harm would ever come to his newfound home again.

And so, the village continued to thrive, a shining example of resilience and the enduring power of community. The sorcerer's tale was passed down through generations, a reminder that even in the face of darkness, hope and courage can light the way.
